Tennis Analysis
As Sport Trader, one of the most common question that I receive from friends is ” What is the best strategy to win by betting? ” and the most popular is the one that betting always on the favorite player can guarantee a profit.

Let’s demonstrate with data if this strategy is profitable, so next time that I receive this question I can direct them to this page.

For those who are new to the world of betting let’s do a quick example:

We have a Tennis match, Federer vs Cecchinato.

Let’s say you bet 10€ on Federer with an odd of 1.1

If he wins, you have back your 10€, plus 1€ of profit
If he loses you’ll return will be 0€
If he wins, as you bet 10€ and won 11€, your ROI (return on investment) is 10%
If he loses, your ROI is -100%
If you place 10 bets of 10€ each at an odd of 1.10, the total stake will be 100€, the return 110€(including the stake), so the profit will be 10€.

If you just lose 1 of these 10 bets, you’ll return including the stake will be 99€, a loss of 1€. If you lose 2 bets, you’ll return including stake will be 88€, a loss of 11€.

So you need to win several bets in order to guarantee you a profit.

Is it really sustainable?

Dataset

I used all ATP MATCHES from 2010 to 2021, in the dataset we have a lot of interesting data such as tournament names, players, odds, etc.

Our focus will be on analyzing the possible strategies to make a profit.
